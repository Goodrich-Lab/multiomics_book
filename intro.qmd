# Introduction

This book has three different sections, corresponding to each of the columns shown in @fig-1. In [Chapter @sec-HIMA], we provide the code for performing high dimensional mediation with early, intermediate, and late integration, illustrated in the first column of @fig-1. In [Chapter @sec-med_lf]

## The Data  
The data used in this project is based off of simulated data from the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) cohort [@RN38]. The simulation for this project was performed using **qj add details**. This data can be accessed at @https://github.com/Goodrich-Lab/multiomics_book/tree/main/0_data. The format of this data is a named list with 6 elements. This includes separate numeric matrices for each of the 5 omics layers, as well as the exposure and phenotype data. In all datasets in this list, the rows represent individuals and the columns represent omics features. 

You can read this data into R with **jg to update**: 
```{r}
# readRDS("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Goodrich-Lab/multiomics_book/blob/main/0_data/simulate_Hg_ck18_screened_scaled_omics.RDS")

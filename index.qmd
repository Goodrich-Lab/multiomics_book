# Preface {.unnumbered}

The integration of multiple omics datasets offers unprecedented insights into the complex interplay of environmental and biological factors, providing a comprehensive picture of individual health and disease. However, to harness the full potential of multiomics data, researchers need a robust framework for understanding how and why to perform different multiomic integration techniques as well as .

This book is intended as a resource for researchers aiming to incorporate omics datasets to understand how environmental or genetic factors impact human health and disease. Our goal is to explain the concepts, techniques, and methodologies that can allow researchers to fully leverage the information contained in multidimensional datasets in order to obtain biologically relevant and actionable insights into environmental and genetic impacts on disease.

This book has three sections, corresponding to each of the columns shown in @fig-1.  In [Chapter @sec-HIMA], we provide an example of high dimensional mediation with early, intermediate, and late integration, as shown in the first column of @fig-1. In [Chapter @sec-med_lf], we provide an example of mediation with latent factors, a two step approach which first uses dimensionality reduction on the omics datasets, and then performs mediation on the resulting factors, as shown in the second column of @fig-1. In [Chapter @sec-quasi], we provide an example of quasi/intermediate integration, an approach  where information on environmental factors and information on multiple omic layers is analyzed jointly in a single unified analysis, as shown in column 3 of @fig-1
